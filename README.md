Heart Disease Classification 

About the dataset 

Context
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Attribute Information:

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

About the project 

This project uses binary classification to predict whether the patient has cancer or not. This project uses seaborn and matplotlib for data visualisation. In this project, I've also implemented manual logistic regression. In this project, I've trained the data on different clssification models and the model with highest F-score is considered!!
